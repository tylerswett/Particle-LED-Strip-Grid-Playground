# Particle Pixel Grid Playground

This is an area for me to mess around with various random ideas I have for projects involving IoT connected NeoPixel grids.

My specific implementation utilizes Particle boards (specifically the Photon), but this code can easily be adapted for other Arduinos.

Select a project folder for further details and have fun playing around with it ðŸ™‚
